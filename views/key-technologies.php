                        <h3>Technologies that drive our innovation</h3>
                        <p>The right technologies support the strength of each project. We utilize a modern, proven, and scalable stack that enables us to develop reliable, secure, and future-proof solutions.</p>

                        <h4>Software Development</h4>
                        <p>We build robust and flexible applications using a wide range of languages such as Java, Python, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Go, Kotlin, and Swift. We rely on leading frameworks, including Spring Boot, .NET, React, Angular, Vue.js, Flutter, and Node.js, and work with scalable databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and Redis. With collaboration and deployment tools like GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Docker, we ensure that every line of code is aligned with quality and efficiency.</p>

                        <h4>Cloud and infrastructure</h4>
                        <p>We bring our customers to the cloud with platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, optimizing their operations with advanced orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes. We apply DevOps practices with tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins, guaranteeing agile, secure, and scalable infrastructures.</p>

                        <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
                        <p>Digital protection is our priority. We use leading tools such as Fortinet, Palo Alto, Splunk, Wireshark, and Nessus. We apply modern security practices, including DevSecOps, Zero Trust models, and Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM), to always protect data and systems.</p>

                        <h4>Data and artificial intelligence</h4>
                        <p>We transform data into knowledge using Big Data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. We develop AI and ML models with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, and transform insights into intelligent decisions with analytics platforms such as Power BI, Tableau, and Google Data Studio. Our expertise includes cloud databases such as Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift, which ensure scalability and speed of analysis.</p>

                        <h4>Project Management</h4>
                        <p>We organize and execute projects using world-class tools such as Asana, Jira, and ClickUp, applying agile practices like Scrum and Kanban that enable you to manage with flexibility, transparency, and efficiency, even in marketing and communication projects.</p>
